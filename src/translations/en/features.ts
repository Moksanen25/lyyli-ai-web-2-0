          'In tech-savvy, fast-moving companies, communication needs to be fast, clear, and coordinated. But in reality, it\'s often scattered, reactive, and inconsistent—especially in hybrid or remote teams. That\'s where Lyyli steps in.',
          'Lyyli monitors your Slack or Teams environment, suggests relevant content based on your actual internal discussions, writes full posts or messages with the right tone, and schedules them for publishing across internal and external channels. From internal updates and LinkedIn posts to customer newsletters, Lyyli keeps your voice aligned and active—without anyone manually managing it.',

It tracks client themes, meeting notes, and internal chats to suggest posts, write newsletters, and generate thought leadership articles that reflect your voice and insights. Everything is consistent, timely, and brand-aligned.',
